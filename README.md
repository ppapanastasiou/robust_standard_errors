The R version of the code is a direct translation of the MATLAB code. 
The MATLAB codes are from LeSages toolbox which can be found here:https://www.spatial-econometrics.com/
For a nice discussion on RSE please refer to the Econometric Computing Learning Resource (ECLR) from Manchester University :http://eclr.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/index.php/RobInf
